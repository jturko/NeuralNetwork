# NeuralNetwork
A very simple neural network in C++. Most of the work in here is inspired by the first two chapters the [free book by 
Michael Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com). Things to look at in the future:
- matrix operations use ```new``` operator and this can easily cause memory leaks
- weight matrices and biases are initialized randomly, but there are smarter ways to do this
- a whole lot more...
